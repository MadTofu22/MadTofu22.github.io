      <p>Here are the questions I had during this weeks assignment:</p>
    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->
      <ol>
        <li>When writing an anonymous arrow function, is it bad form to leave it in a single line like I did in my comment for problem 6?</li>
        <li>Since arrays have a built in .foreach() method, is it best practice to use that or a for/of loop to iterate through them?</li>
      </ol>
