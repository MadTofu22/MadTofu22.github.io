    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Is there a case where a template literal would not be returning a string? If not, why wasn't the template literal ability added to strings in '' instead of requiring ``?</p>

    <p>Similar to the last question, you can use ``, '', or "" for a string in javascript. I know in C++ for instance '' will store the string as an array of chars where "" is a single object. Is this the same in javascript? If not is there a best practice for which format to use, assuming you aren't using `` for template literal purposes?</p>

    <p>Since the script tag does not self close and you can add javascript code directly into the html file, is it possible to write a function in the html, and then pass that to a referenced javascript file? For instance getting an IP from a connecting user then passing that to the aboutMe.js file in this assignment?</p>

    <p>In the stretch goal section there were a couple possible cases that didn't have instruction provided on how to handle them (ex. negaitve pets). I added code into to handle that anyway, is that ok or should I just leave those cases out next time?</p>
